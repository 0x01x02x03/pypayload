Automatic Metasploit Payload Generator

## Introduction

__Metasploit__ is a great suite for penetration testing. However, I tend to find it a hassle to create a payload utilizing Metasploit's __msfvenom__, and created this project in order to automate that process.

## A few problems...

This project will still be a work-in-progress. If you examine the source code, you can see how unoptimized it is, and could use some major work. Since Metasploit is written in Ruby, there aren't any module/libraries for Python that I personally think is useful for this project.
[Pymsf](http://www.primalsecurity.net/python-for-metasploit-automation/) is pretty good, but it's not very fit for my project.

## Dependencies

* Metasploit
* Python 2.7.x
